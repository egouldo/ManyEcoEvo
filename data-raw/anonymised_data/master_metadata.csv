beta_estimate,"This is a slope or contrast from a statistical model describing the relationship between the response variable and the predictor ('test') variable in the model identified in this row. The sign has been standardized to reflect a priori hypotheses (that increased competition reduces growth in blue tit chicks, and that more grass cover increases eucalyptus seedling success). The sign from this effect should be used to determine the sign for the effect size used in the effect-size meta-analysis."
contrast,"indicates whether the the reported effect size is a 'slope' or, if it is a contrast, what the contrast is (which categories of blue tit brood sizes manipulate are being compared ('control-enlarged', 'reduced-control', or 'reduced-enlarged')"
adjusted_df,degrees of freedom calculated by the method we provided to the analysts. This df is for use in calculating the effect size.
beta_SE,SE (standard error) associated with the beta_for_analysis
transformation,"link function based on link_functionS2 but edited by THP based on reported error distributions (family) and/or link in generalized models (in survey or code). If reported values back-transformed, that is indicated by 'back.transformed'"
link_function_reported,link function based on link_functionS2 but edited by THP based on reported error distributions (family) and/or link in generalized models (in survey or code)

response_id_S2,original
test_variable,the standardized name of the predictor variable identified by the analyst as testing the hypothesis of interest. Standardized by THP 2022.06
sample_size,"The number of rows of data used in the data analysis. We did not request this information in the survey and so we derived it from the submitted materials (output, methods, results) when possible"
Bayesian,indicates whether the analysis was Bayesian (1) or not (0). Originally created by HF. Some edits THP
linear_model,all effects classified as coming from 'linear' or 'generalised' models. Some edits THP
model_subclass,"classification of model type including exponential_variance, hurdle, lasso_regression, mixture_model, PCA, quadratic_variance, quantile_regression, standard, zero_inflated, zero_inflated_hurdle. Originally created by HF. Some edits THP"
num_variables,Number of predictor variables (both fixed and random) included in the model that produced the effect in this row. Variables included >1 time in a model (for instance in an interaction or in a quadratic term) are counted only once
num_effects,"Number of predictor effects (both fixed and random) included in the model that produced the effect in this row. Interactions, quadratic terms, or other terms in which a variable may be included >1 time are all counted in this variable"
num_fixed_variables,Number of fixed predictor variables included in the model that produced the effect in this row. Variables included >1 time in a model (for instance in an interaction or in a quadratic term) are counted only once
num_fixed_effects,"Number of fixed predictor effects included in the model that produced the effect in this row. Interactions, quadratic terms, or other terms in which a variable may be included >1 time are all counted in this variable"
num_random_variables,Number of random predictor variables included in the model that produced the effect in this row. Variables included >1 time in a model (for instance in an interaction or in a quadratic term) are counted only once
num_random_effects,Number of random predictor effects included in the model that produced the effect in this row. This only occurred when nesting different fixed variables within the same random variable in different terms
num_interactions,Number of interaction terms included in the model
num_duplicate_terms,"Number of cases in which a variable already included once the model is included an additional time in some transformed state (e.g., as a quadratic term)"
exclusions_all,"effects that should be excluded from all meta-analyses ('exclude') for reasons including selection of inappropriate response or predictor variables, or insufficient information to understand what was included in their model VS effects to be include ('retain')"
exclusions_effect_analysis,"effects that should be excluded from the effect-size meta-analysis (primarily due to a lack of degrees of freedom) ('exclude_all') or excluded only from the more conservative effect-size meta-analysis (primarily because they provided identical degrees of freedom for two seperate effects) ('exclude_partial'), or retained for all effect-size meta-analyses ('retain'). This column does NOT address whether an out-of-sample prediction should be excluded from analysis."
exclusion_predictions,"identifies effects that should be excluded from out-of-sample predictions analysis ('exclude'), most often because of a lack of an appropriate predictions file. Many rows not assessed for exclusion (for instance because no file submitted, or because the entire analysis excluded as indicated in the 'exclusions-all' column), and these are labled 'NA'."
